## Items to implement for AI

-   Setup advanced position points for each piece
-   Limit database depth to 10 (5 + 5) for openings and see which move has the highest success rate
-   Make the bot prioritise eating over moving just by a bit but not for Queens or Rooks (Endgame Monster)
-   Setup endgame monster to limit King's spaces

## Done

-   Convert each Move object to a chess Board notation taking in the board object
